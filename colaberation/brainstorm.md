# Brainstorm Idea's
These are some of the ideas that we had:

## Are Powerpoints's, or spread sheets the same as Documents?

### Pro's
- not to hard
- probably because it's so similar easy to find material about it

### Cons's
- Might be allready covered in the paper itself

## Are PDF's the same as Documents? (Diference between PDF and Microsoft office signatures's security)

### Pro's
- Easy to find sources.

### Cons's
- read another long essay

## Isn't easier in this day and age to have some signoff process on a server somewhere in the cloud?

### Pro's
- looks exciting

### Cons's
- 

## Real life explotation of the vulnarability.

### Pro's
- really unique
- gets us a high grade

### Cons's
- impossible without years of experience


## Signing a document, and then zipping it

### Pro's
- really unique
- gets us a high grade
- 

### Cons's
- 

### idea
What if we add a version control system to a document, and then sign a specific commit? This would mean that the entire document, or repository is signed, and cannot be tampered with. Then if you make changes, a simple `git diff` would show you EXACTLY what changed, then you can sign that, and BOOM, now you've got a document that is signed, and any changes, made by any party will have to be signed. Now the only way to change the document while keeping it valid, is to sign it yourself as the attacker.
